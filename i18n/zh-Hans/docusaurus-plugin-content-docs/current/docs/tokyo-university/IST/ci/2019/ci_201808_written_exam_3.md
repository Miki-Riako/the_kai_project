### Inverse kinematics
Inverse kinematics is the usage of kinematic equasions to determine the motions of a robot in order to reach a desired position. Kinematics itself is the study of motion regardless of the cause of the motion, such as forces and torques. Use cases can include the motion of picking bins or items from the assembly line. Given a starting joint position and a desired position, inverse kinematics can determine the join movement needed to achieve that.

### Hidden Markov model
Public key cryptography refers to an encryption and security algorithm which uses a public key and a private key to secure a communication between two sides. Each side has a private key which is not revealed and a public key which is known. This method relies on the difficulty of decomposing a number which is the result of a multiplication of large prime numbers, as well as the traits of modulu operations. An example of such an encryption is the RSA encription.
